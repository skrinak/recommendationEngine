# Introduction to Object2Vec

In this workshop you will develop a recommendation engine using SageMaker's built-in algorithm, Object2Vec. We use the same MovieLens dataset as the previous Lab. 

## Prerequisites
### AWS Account

To complete this workshop you'll need an AWS Account with access rights to S3, SageMaker, and to create AWS IAM roles. The code and instructions in this workshop assume only one participant is using a given AWS account at a time. If you try sharing an account with another participant, you'll run into naming conflicts for certain resources. You can work around these by appending a unique suffix to the resources that fail to create due to naming conflicts. However, these instructions do not provide details on the changes required to make this work.

All of the resources you will launch as part of this workshop are eligible for the AWS free tier if your account is less than 12 months old. See the AWS Free Tier page for more details.

### Browser

We recommend you use the latest version of Firefox or Chrome to complete this workshop.

## Steps

1. If you have already completed Steps 1 through 3 from "Lab 1" of this workshop, please proceed to step 2 here. Otherwise, go to [Lab 1 - Introduction to Factorization Machines](../Lab1%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Factorization%20Machines) and complete the 3 steps required to setup SageMaker and your S3 buckets. Also, this workshop assumes all SageMaker instances and S3 buckets are in the Ireland.

1. Time to run the notebook. But, don't just hammer on shift-return: read carefully about the theory, seek to understand, examine and run each cell. Then, return to these instructions. 

    * You may be asked to change the kernel when you open the notebook. Set it to conda_python3.
    * The first code cell of the notebook requires you to set the bucket variable to the custom bucket name you created in the first lab. 
	* Don't be alarmed by red log messages while training your model. SageMaker prints ordinary log messages in red. Wall time for training takes about 4 minutes per model. **Do not proceed to the next step until the notebook has fully completed and each cell has run.**
    * Open the notebook, [object2vec_movie_recommendation.ipynb](object2vec_movie_recommendation.ipynb) in this directory and proceed. 
	* When the notebook is completed successfully, go to the [SageMaker console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker) and nagivate to **Models** as well as **Endpoints** sections to take a look at the models and endpoints created by the notebook.

1. Go to the [IAM console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/). Let's create the Lambda execution role. This role is for our Lambda functions to have sufficient permissions to perform tasks such as getting objects from S3 and invoking an endpoint that is deployed in SageMaker. Click on "Roles" from the left navigation and then "Create Role".

     ![Lambda IAM](images/lambda-iam.jpg)

    - From the list of AWS Services choose: Lambda. Click on Next:Permissions.
    - Use the search box to add ```S3FullAccess```, and ```AmazonSageMakerFullAccess``` individually. You do this by searching, clicking on the on the checkbox, searching again, and selecting the next policy. Note that this is a highly permissive configuration that should not be used in production. It is only intended to facilitate learning in this workshop.
    - After you have added all 2 policies click on Next:Tags, and then Next:Review.
    - For Role Name use ```Lambda_ServerlessWorkshop_Role```.
    - Click on Create role.

1. Go to the Lambda console and create a Lambda function that calls 2 endpoints that were deployed in the previous step. 
    - Enter the following values:
        - Name: **Recommendation_Engine_Object2Vec** 
        - Rumitime: **Python 3.6**
        - Role: **Choose an existing role**
        - Existing role: Enter ```Lambda_ServerlessWorkshop_Role``` as created in the previous step.
    - Click on the **Create function** button.

1. Open [lambda_function_rec_engine.py](lambda_function_rec_engine.py) and paste the code into the "Function code" section of the Lambda console. 

    ![Lambda console1](images/lambda-console-1.jpg)

1. On the Lambda console, create 2 environment variables.

    ![Lambda console2](images/lambda-console-2.jpg)

    - The first environment variable with the following specifications:
        - Key: **ENDPOINT_NAME_RATING**
        - Value: **ratingModel** 
    - The second environment variable with the following specifications:
        - Key: **ENDPOINT_NAME_REC**
        - Value: **recommendationModel**
    
    You can find name of your model endpoints on SageMaker console under **Inference** -> **Endpoints** as shown in the following screenshot. Alternatively, you can find them on the notebook you ran to create them. How to know which model is for rating and which for recommendation? Look at the time stamp. Rating model is created first so the date stamp should be earlier for the rating model. 

    ![SageMaker console](images/sageMaker-console-1.jpg)

1. Create test event by selecting "Configure test events" on the dropdown list next to the "Test" button as shown in the following screenshot.

    ![Lambda console3](images/lambda-console-3.jpg)

    Enter the following value and click on the Save button on the lower right. 

	```
    {
        "data": "{ \"instances\": [{\"in0\": [789], \"in1\": [286]}]}",
        "type": "rating"
    }
	```

    ![Lambda console4](images/lambda-console-4.jpg)

1. Now test your function by clicking on the **Test** button at the top of the console. You should see the output like following. Test recommendation by passing ```"type": "recommendation"``` in your test event to see the movie recommendation, also.

    ![Lambda console5](images/lambda-console-5.jpg)

## Movie retrieval in the embedding space *(Optional)*

 Time permitting, let's utilize the recommendation model to explore embeddings. We will retrieve a movie in the embedding space since Object2Vec transforms user and movie IDs into embeddings as part of training process. We expect that similar movies should be close-by in the embedding space. You will be creating another Lambda function to find a nearest-neighbor of a given movie ID calling the endpoint of recommendation model we developed in the previous steps. 

1. First, we are going to transfer 2 dataset files to our s3 bucket. Open a Terminal on the SageMaker instance. See where to find the terminal in the following screenshot. 

    ![SageMaker console4](images/notebook-instance4.jpg)

    Run the following command. Make sure to replace 
    * ```your-bucket-name``` with the bucket you created in the previous steps. *Note: you may recall ```rec-engine-workshop-yourname``` was a recommended bucket name*.
    * ```your-region``` with the region in which your data resides. 

    ```
    cd SageMaker/recommendationEngine/Lab2\ -\ Introduction\ to\ Object2Vec/

    aws s3api put-object --bucket your-bucket-name --key object2vec/movielens/ml-100k/ua.base --body ml-100k/ua.base --region your-region
    
    aws s3api put-object --bucket your-bucket-name --key object2vec/movielens/ml-100k/u.item --body ml-100k/u.item --region your-region
    ```

1. Next we will go back to the Lambda console and repeat the step 4 this time with the following specification:

    - Enter the following values:
        - Name: **Movie_Retrieval_Object2Vec** 
        - Runtime: **Python 3.6**
        - Role: **Choose an existing role**
        - Existing role: Enter the Lambda Execution Role created in the previous step.
    - Click on the **Create function** button.
    - Copy the code from [lambda_function_movie_retrieval.py](lambda_function_movie_retrieval.py) and paste it into Function code section of the newly created Lambda function. 
    - Create  environment variable with the following specifications:
        - Key: **ENDPOINT_NAME**
        - Value: **recommendationModel**

1. Set the Basic settings with the following values:

    - Memory: **512 MB**
    - Timeout: **30 seconds**

    ![Lambda console6](images/lambda-console-6.jpg)

1. This Lambda function uses 2 Lambda Layers. One for jsonlines library and another for numpy library. We will go step by step. 

    First, download **jsonlines_Layers.zip** from the SageMaker notebook instance.

    ![SageMaker console5](images/notebook-instance5.jpg) 
    
    We will create jsonline layer by clicking on **Create layer** button on upper right corner. 

    ![Lambda layer1](images/lambda-layer-1.jpg)

1. Fill in the following value to the console:

    - Name: **jsonlines**
    - Compatible runtime: **Python 3.6**
    - Upload **jsonlines_Layers.zip**

    ![Lambda layer2](images/lambda-layer-2.jpg)

    When the Layer is created, copy the ARN which looks something like this: ```arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:<your_account_number>:layer:jsonlines:1```

1. After the one layer creation, go back to the Movie_Retrieval_Object2Vec function. Click on the **Layers** icon shown in the following screenshot:

    ![Lambda layer3](images/lambda-layer-3.jpg)

    This will bring up the following **Referenced layers** pane. Click on **Add a layer** button.

    ![Lambda layer4](images/lambda-layer-4.jpg)

    You will see the following window show up. Select the option **Select from list of runtime compatible layers**. From **Layer** dropdown, select **AWSLambda-Python36-SciPy1x** as it includes numpy which will be referenced in the function code. 

    ![Lambda layer5](images/lambda-layer-5.jpg)

    Repeat the step to add jsonlines layer only this time, select **Provide a layer version ARN** option. Enter the ARN you copied in the previous step in the textbox. 

    ![Lambda layer6](images/lambda-layer-6.jpg)

 1. Now you get to test the Lambda function by creating the test event. As we did in the step 6. This time your text event looks like below. Replace ```your-bucket-name``` with real bucket name you created in the Lab 1. Click on **Test** button to get the result. 

    ```
    {
        "bucket_name": "your-bucket-name",
        "movie_id_to_examine": 2
    }
	```
    You can check out what is the closest movie to any movie in the data set. Last time we ran it, the closest movie to Terminator, The (1984) in the embedding space was Die Hard (1988). Note that, the result will likely differ slightly across different runs of the algorithm, due to randomness in initialization of model parameters.

    Just plug in the movie id you want to examine
    For example, the movie ID for Terminator is 195; you can find the movie name and ID pair in the u.item file

## Congratulations!

You've successfully created a recommendation engine using SageMaker's built-in algorithm, Object2Vec. You developed 2 Lambda functions to test the models. This method can apply to recommendation other than movies. After you clean up return to the top level of this repo for [next steps](https://github.com/skrinak/recommendationEngine). 

## Cleanup
After you have completed the workshop you can delete all of the resources that were created in the following order.
1. Delete 2 SageMaker model endpoints.
1. Stop the SageMaker notebook instance.
1. Delete the SageMaker notebook instance.
1. Delete the S3 Buckets you created. 

## Personalize
Amazon recently announced [Amazon Personalize](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/), a machine learning service that makes it easy for developers to create individualized recommendations at scale. This service handles the majority of tasks we've just completed by hand. Before embarking on developing your own solutions from scratch it is well worth the time investment to see if Personalize has already solved this problem for you. 

A compact end-to-end demo of the same kind of recommendation engine we've built here today can be found here: <a href="http://www.personalisevideorecs.info/recommend/" target="_blank">Amazon Personalize Video Recommendations</a>
